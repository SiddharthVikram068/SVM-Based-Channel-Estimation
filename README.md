# SVM-Based Channel Estimation for One-Bit Massive MIMO (Assignment Implementation)

This repository contains a complete implementation and experimental evaluation of the channel estimation methods proposed in the paper:

> **H. Nguyen et al., “SVM-Based Channel Estimation and Data Detection for One-Bit Massive MIMO Systems,” IEEE TSP, 2021.**

The focus of this project is **channel estimation only**, under:
- Flat-fading uncorrelated channels  
- Flat-fading spatially correlated channels  
- OFDM (frequency-selective) channels  
- An extended case with **spatially correlated noise**

All experiments reproduce (qualitatively) the trends of the figures in the paper, particularly Figures 3, 6, and 12.

## 📚 **Brief Summary of the Paper (in simple terms)**

Massive MIMO systems use a very large number of antennas at the base station. However, using high-precision Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) at each antenna is power-hungry and expensive.

The paper studies **one-bit ADCs**, where each received signal sample is quantized to only its sign (`+1` or `-1`). This drastically reduces hardware cost and power consumption, but makes channel estimation much harder because amplitude information is lost.

### Key idea of the paper:
Instead of using traditional linear estimators (like LMMSE/BMMSE), the authors formulate **channel estimation as a classification problem** and solve it using **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**.

The main contributions implemented in this repo are:

- ✅ SVM-based channel estimation for **uncorrelated flat-fading channels**
- ✅ A **joint SVM formulation** that exploits **spatial correlation**
- ✅ A **time-domain SVM approach for OFDM systems**
- ✅ An **extended study with correlated noise**

## 📁 **File Structure and What Each File Does**

### ✅ `uncorrelated_channels.py`
Implements the **proposed SVM-based channel estimation** for **uncorrelated flat-fading channels** (Section II.B.1 of the paper).

What it does:
- Generates i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels  
- Uses DFT-based pilot sequences  
- Converts the system to real domain  
- Solves an independent SVM per antenna  
- Computes and plots **NMSE vs SNR**

This reproduces (qualitatively) **Figure 3** of the paper.

### ✅ `comparison.py`
Compares:
- Uncorrelated SVM estimator  
- Correlated SVM estimator  

What it does:
- Generates spatially correlated channels using a Laplacian-style covariance model  
- Solves the **joint SVM optimization problem (Eq. 20 in the paper)** using CVXPY  
- Plots both NMSE curves on the same figure  

This corresponds to **Figure 6** in the paper.

---

### ✅ `corr_noise.py`
Extends the correlated-channel case to **spatially correlated noise**.

What it does:
- Generates colored (correlated) Gaussian noise using a covariance matrix  
- Applies the same SVM-based estimator  
- Compares NMSE performance with:
  - White noise  
  - Correlated noise  

This is an **extension beyond the paper**, as required by the assignment.

---

### ✅ `ofdm_extension.py`
Implements the **OFDM extension** of the SVM-based channel estimator (Section IV.A of the paper).

What it does:
- Uses frequency-domain pilots (orthogonal across users)  
- Converts pilots to time domain via IFFT  
- Constructs a circulant training matrix from time-domain pilots  
- Performs **per-antenna SVM estimation in the time domain**  
- Computes NMSE vs SNR  

This reproduces (qualitatively) **Figure 12** of the paper.
